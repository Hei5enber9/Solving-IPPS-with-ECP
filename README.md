# Solving the integrated process planning and scheduling problem using an enhanced constraint programming-based approach

## ./Gantt Charts/
All Gantt Charts for Experiment 1-5 are presented in this file.

## ./Experiment Results.xlsx
Details of Experiment 1-6.

## Note
We omitted something in Constraint 24 in the revised manuscript. It should be that 
$${\rm PresenceOf}(ops[seq_i[1]]) => {\rm PresenceOf}(ops[seq_i[2]]) \quad \forall seq_i \in SEQ, {\rm type}(seq_i) > 0 \qquad (24)$$

We will fix the typo if we have the next revision.
